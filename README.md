# Description
A Python program that solves sudoku problems with backtracking. It checks for empty cells and chooses numbers between 1 to 9 to see which one is valid. The program checks if the number is already in the row, column and box. If it isn't, it's valid. If a solution can't be found at that time, it backtracks and changes the number to 0 and tries again. 

Tried this out with what's known as the 'world's hardest sudoku problem', developed by Finnish mathematician Arto Inkala. The solution by the program matches the one found online.
